# Open hardware in academia
## An experts' survey to identify policy options

### What is a real-time Delphi exercise?
The Delphi is a process designed to combine opinion into group consensus and identifying dissent. Experts from multiple backgrounds are invited to provide their opinion on pre-defined statements anonymously. 

### Why this study now?
In the last five years, open hardware has gained traction as an alternative technology transfer paradigm in academia. Practitioners claim open hardware increases the impact of academic research, while making science more efficient and reproducible. The inclusion of open hardware as part of the UNESCO Open Science Recommendation has sparked wider interest in the topic. However, to date there's no comprehensive survey of experts' opinions on if and how to support open hardware practices in academia.  

### How does it work?
Experts are asked to rate a series of policy recommendations in terms of desirability, feasibility and importance. The statementes are obtained from interviews with experts and available literature. The platform allows the experts to add a justification for their choices, input their level of confidence in the decision and check how other experts rated each question before. They are then given the opportunity to modify their rating or not, based on the available information. 

### How is data used
Responses to this survey are anonymous; other experts will not be able to identify your responses in the platform. 

The data obtained from this survey will be stored in an encrypted server at University of Bath, and analysed by Dr. Julieta Arancio. It will be used to write a policy brief on the topic to be published in 2023. All respondents will receive a copy of the brief before it is published. 

### How are experts selected?
Experts are selected considering their background: open science hardware development, business models based on open science hardware, academic research on the topic, open science champions, university research management, technology transfer or policy, or work in related non-profits/international organisations.

If you know an expert who should participate, please send me an email to ja2153@bath.ac.uk

### Who is supporting this study?
This study is funded by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. 

## Practical info

- The platform opens on **October 24th** and closes on **November 14th**
- You can access it with a link I'll share via email with you
- It works in all browsers + mobile, but there is no save option: if you close the browser the survey starts from zero
- I estimate the whole exercise to take no more than 40 minutes
- There is a compensation of USD200 for experts who complete the exercise## I need help

Make sure you check the [Youtube walkthrough](https://youtu.be/zOwgR2-CujU) before completing the survey.
